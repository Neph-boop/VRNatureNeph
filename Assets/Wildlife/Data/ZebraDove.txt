longDescription: Zebra doves, locally known as bato-bato, are one of the most common birds you can find on campus. They are quite well adapted to urban life. You can catch a glimpse of them in parking lots and fields, just open your eyes wide out â€˜cause they blend in well with the rocks with their predominantly gray feathers and striped pattern.
